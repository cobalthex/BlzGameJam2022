Blizzard Gam Jammers 2022
Theme - Growth

Concept: A city building simulation game where you play as an alien hivemind that is terraforming, infesting a planet, and repurposing its resources. 
Direct your workers to spread and improve your colony to conquer the world and make it yours.

Core Mechanics
- Building "Structures" grow and spread like organic entities creating unique patterns based on how you nurture them.
- Worker "Drones" make decisions about how to advance the colony based on your given guidance and priorities.
- Hostile "Threats" and Benefitial "Boons" populate the land for the colony to defend against or exploit

Primary Gameloop
- The player begins by choosing a location and placing their main Hivemind Hub structure which serves as the central hub of their colony
- The Hivemind Hub creates the player's first Drone worker which they can provide with priorities and a strategy.
- The Hivemind's area of influence grows over time such that it can begin to generate other structures and upgrade to improve its primary functions.
- The Drones will collect resources and construct other structures over time as per their AI orders.

The World
The area that the player has access to will be a grid based navmesh where they can place structures and drones can navigate around.
World levels will be pre-populated with Threats and Boons and other terrain features for the player to build around (time permitting this could be procedurally generated).

Resources
Resources needed by the player will be Organic Matter and Energy, the former can be gathered from various natural resources or grown while the latter will be generated by structures using water. Buildings will require various amounts of these resources to be constructed.

--------
Structures
A major part of the game is centered around the construction of various Structures on the planet's surface. 
These structures make up the functional ecosystem of the colony and determine what capabilities it has to further expand, defend itself, and advance the player's goals.
In general a structure will be an immobile node-like actor placed on the grid of the world either by players, Drones, or other Structures.
Placing a structure directly as opposed to to growing or having a Drone construct it, beyond the initial main hivemind hub, will cost multiples of the Structure Cost.
Structures have areas of influence which colors the grid around them, within this area they can build new structures, influence drones, or automatically gather resources.

Technical Specs
- Structure Name: The string name of the structure
- Structure Type: The categorical type of the structure (eg. Production, Defense, Support, etc) used by Drone AI priority system
- Structure Cost: The amount/type pairings of resources needed to construct the structure
- Structure Footprint: The area of grid space the structure takes up upon placement expressed as the length of one side of its square
- Structure Max Influence Area: The area that the structure's influence can grow to cover expressed as the radius of its circle
- Structure Area Growth Rate: The rate at which the influence area grows per minute
- Structure Growth Pattern: A player-facing and mutable variable used by the structure to determine what kind of pattern to attempt to match as it creates new structures
- Structure Update Function: A function to contain any special mechanics the structure may do per tick rate of the game (eg. spawn units, grow other structures, generate resource, storage, etc)

Content Types
- Hivemind Hub: Generates normal workers and creates any secondary structures nearby
- Military Hub: Generates military drones and creates secondary military structures nearby
- Energy Hub: Generates builder drones and creates secondary energy structures nearby (also increases maximum energy capacity)
- Resource Hub: Generates gatherer drones and creates secondary resources structures nearby (also increases organic material storage)
- Terraform Hub: Generates terraforming drones

- Secondary Military Structure: This structure attacks nearby hostile drones
- Secondary Energy Structure: This structure generates energy by consuming nearby water
- Secondary Resource Structure: This structure grows organic material over time

Possible Add-ons for the player to draw on the grid space
- Roads: Connect buildings or areas with roads that speed up drones when they walk on them
- Walls: Create structures which passively block navigation
- Pipes: Create connections from water sources to buildings (without these implemented buildings will just use water within their area of influence instead)

--------
Drones
The second major part of the game is controlling and directing your Drones in order to guide them to create what your colony needs.
Though the player does not directly tell these workers what to do or where to do it they can set several values within their AI to send them in the right direction.
Based on the player's input these workers will attempt to expand and develop the ecosystem such as collecting resources, building structures, or defending against threats.
Normal Drones are created automatically by the Hivemind Hub based on its upgrade level while other more specialized Drones can be created by other Hubs.

Technical Specs
- Drone Name: The string name of the drone
- Drone Type: The categorical type of the drone (eg. Normal, Military, Gatherer, Builder)
- Drone Priority: A player-facing and mutable variable used by the AI to determine what the drone should be trying to do (eg. Building, Gathering, Defending, Attacking)
- Drone Strategy: A player-facing and mutable variable used by the AI to determine the style in which the drone should accomplish its priority (eg. Dispersed, Clumped, Linear)
- Drone Shared Actions: Several shared action functions for drones that they should be able to execute (eg. Move, Gather, Deliver, Build, Attack, Die)
- Drone Special Actions: Some functions may be special based on the drone type (eg. Military should have an overridden Attack function which can be used at range instead of melee or Gatherers should collect much more resource per trip)
- Drone AI Update: The drone needs some kind of AI function that will update its current actions based on the player's inputs and the state of the game around it.

Content Types
- Normal Drone: Can perform shared actions at a basic rate and efficacy
- Military Drone: Significantly better at combat due to Ranged attack (all Drones take 1 Hit to kill and can attack at a rate of once per 2 sec)
- Builder Drone: Significantly increased rate of construction and able to build more advanced Structures
- Gatherer Drone: Significantly increased travel speed and amount of resource accrual per trip
- Terraforming Drone: Able to use advanced attack and build actions for structures related to terrain (Destroy Cliffs or dig Water Pools)

--------
Threats and Boons
To create an interesting challenge and replayable experience the world will start with a number of Structures and Drones which are scattered throughout the landscape and are different than those the player can control.
These actors range from hostile features which will attack the player's drones and structures, to neutral aspects of the land which may inform the player's build patterns, to beneficial resources for the player to collect and exploit.
These should be styled as such to reuse the pre-established Structure and Drone systems above but with content flavoring that creates a believable fantasy. But we could also look into more complicated ideas time-permitting such as weather systems or natural disasters which might change some aspects of the player's world.

Content Types
- Threat / Predator Spawning Structures: These structures will periodically spawn Predator Drones nearby.
- Threat / Predator Drones: These drones will wander around the world and attack player drones or structures if they get too close. Killing them creates food structures.
- Neutral / Cliff Structures: These Terrain structures block movement but can be destroyed by terraforming drones.
- Beneficial / Tree Structures: Tree structures take up a single grid space, preventing construction or movement, and will attempt to generate new trees on nearby grids. Gathering them will remove them and provide organic material resource.
- Beneficial / Water Pool Structures: These are depressed Terrain areas in the ground which prevent movement through them and generate water resource over time for the player to gather. These can also be dug or removed by terraforming drones.
- Beneficial / Food Structures: These are small structures which do not block movement and can be gathered to collect organic material resource.
- Beneficial / Food Animal Drones: These are benign drones which wander the world and can be attacked by player drones. Upon death they create a food structure.
